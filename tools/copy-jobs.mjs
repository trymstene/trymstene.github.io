// ✍️ THE COPY JOBS — one entry per writing job in Banana World.
//
// A job is: the brief GPT is given, the JSON Schema its answer must satisfy,
// the field limits the gate enforces, and the two files (the draft it writes,
// the approved copy the game imports). Add a job here and the writer, the gate
// and /dev/copy/ all learn about it at once.
//
// No node builtins: an Astro page imports this at build time.

// gives the same cast new words, never a new cast, and this is what pins that.

// for 90. Raising a max is a deliberate act for a commit message, like a budget.
